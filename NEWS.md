# OptimalDesign 1.0.3

* Extended functionality: `od\_MISOCP` now supports D-optimality computation for `m > 10` (previously limited to `m ≤ 10`).
* Updated Gurobi integration: corrected the use of `vtype` to ensure compatibility with Gurobi 12 and later.
* Improved documentation, including a rewritten `OptimalDesign-package.Rd`.
* Fixed several small typos and minor inconsistencies throughout the package.
