To be able to run algorithms based on mathematical programming methods, Gurobi solver and the corresponding R interface are needed. Here we provide instructions for manually installing Gurobi and its R interface in Windows machines.

1. Create a free academic license
	Follow the instructions on: http://www.gurobi.com/documentation/6.5/quickstart_windows/creating_a_new_academic_li.html

2. Install the software
	2.1. In http://www.gurobi.com/index, go to Downloads -> Gurobi Software
	2.2. Choose your operating system and press download

3. Retrieve and set up your Gurobi license
	2.1. Follow the instructions in: http://www.gurobi.com/documentation/6.5/quickstart_windows/retrieving_and_setting_up_.html
	2.2. Then follow the instructions in: http://www.gurobi.com/documentation/6.5/quickstart_windows/retrieving_a_free_academic.html

4. Test your license
	Follow the instructions in: http://www.gurobi.com/documentation/6.5/quickstart_windows/testing_your_license.html

5. Install the R interface of Gurobi	
	Follow the instructions in: http://www.gurobi.com/documentation/6.5/quickstart_windows/r_installing_the_r_package.html
	* In Windows, in R run the command install.packages("PATH\\gurobi_6.5-1.zip", repos=NULL) where path leads to the file gurobi_6.5-1.zip (for example PATH=C:\\gurobi651\\win64\\R)
		
6. Test the installation 
	Load the library and run the examples therein
	* A possible error that you may get is the following: "Error: package ‘slam’ required by ‘gurobi’ could not be found". In that case, run install.packages('slam') and try again.
